# Restaurant Website

A simple and responsive restaurant website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Description
This is a restaurant website project built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The website features a homepage, an about page, food listings, a gallery section, a detailed menu, an order page, and a blog section. Originally created by following a YouTube tutorial, I made several improvements to the layout, responsiveness, and styling to better fit modern web standards. This project helped me strengthen my frontend development skills and practice building full website structures.

## Features
- Home section with welcome message and introduction
- About page describing the restaurant's story
- Food section highlighting special dishes
- Gallery showcasing food and restaurant images
- Full menu display with categorized items
- Order form for placing food orders
- Blogs section for news or updates
- Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## Notes
This project was developed as part of my learning journey in frontend web development. It combines multiple sections into a single-page and multi-section layout to simulate a real restaurant website.
